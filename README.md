Implementing the banking account service by implementing the 3 methods, the deposit method that adds to the balance, the withdraw method that takes from the balance as long as the operation is possible, if not it raises an exception, and then the method that prints the transactions from the newest to the oldest.
In the main method I tested the methods on the 3 transactions mentioned in the test.
